## What is Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz to simplify writing for the web. Unlike complex formats like LaTeX, Markdown uses plain-text syntax that converts seamlessly to HTML, PDFs, and other formatsâ€”making it perfect for notes, docs, and even websites.

## Why Markdown?

Easy to Learn: Format text with symbols like #, *, and -.
Portable: Works everywhere (GitHub, blogs, note-taking apps).
Versatile: Supports tables, code blocks, and embedded HTML.

## Basic Syntax

# Heading 1  
## Heading 2  

- List item  
**Bold** or *italic*  

[Link](https://example.com)  
`inline code`  

## Where It Shines

- GitHub Docs: .md files power READMEs and wikis.
- Static Sites: Used with generators like Jekyll or Hugo.
- Note-Taking: Apps like Obsidian and Notion rely on it.

## Limitations

No native support for complex layouts (e.g., multi-column text).
Syntax varies slightly across implementations (CommonMark vs. GitHub Flavored Markdown).
