## Last Week's Recap

It was a whirlwind of coding and caffeine-fueled nights as I juggled coursework deadlines with hands-on projects. I spent three late nights debugging numerical analysis assignments, but the breakthrough came when I optimized my matrix computation algorithm. Between coding marathons, I attended our robotics club demo—where I learned soldering the hard way (with a few accidental burns to prove it). Coffee consumption hit record levels (averaging four cups a day), but it paid off when I finally got Pandas to parse my sensor data correctly. The week wasn’t without mishaps—I crashed my Python kernel twice testing memory-heavy simulations and nearly lost a day’s work before Git came to the rescue. On the bright side, I discovered a killer Matplotlib trick for visualizations, though I missed breakfast three times chasing down bugs. By Friday, I was exhausted but proud—another week of balancing chaos and progress in the life of a STEM student.
