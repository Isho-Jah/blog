## My last week of march

This past week was a whirlwind of deadlines, caffeine, and just enough fun to keep me sane! Between back-to-back classes and a major midterm that had me glued to my notes, I definitely earned those dark circles under my eyes. But it wasn’t all stress—I stole moments of joy at the club’s game night, where laughing over board games with friends reminded me there’s life beyond textbooks. Sure, I survived on instant noodles and 3am study sessions, but hey, that’s the student hustle, right? Here’s to hoping next week brings slightly more sleep and slightly fewer highlighters running dry. ✨ #StudentDiaries #SurvivalMode
