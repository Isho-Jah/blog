## What is version control 

Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It is particularly useful in software development for managing source code, but it can be applied to any set of files. Version control systems (VCS) enable multiple people to collaborate on projects, track changes, and revert to previous states if something goes wrong. By maintaining a history of modifications, version control helps teams work more efficiently and ensures that everyone is working with the most up-to-date and accurate information.

## How does it work?

Version control works by creating a repository, which is a database that stores all the changes and history of a project. When you make changes to files, you can stage those changes and then commit them to the repository. Each commit is a snapshot of the project at a particular point in time, accompanied by a message describing the changes. This process allows you to track the evolution of your project and revert to previous versions if needed. Branches can be created to work on new features or fixes independently, and these branches can later be merged back into the main codebase. This branching and merging capability is crucial for collaborative development, as it allows multiple people to work on different aspects of a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

In a version control system, collaboration is facilitated through remote repositories, which serve as a central hub for sharing changes. Developers clone the remote repository to their local machines, make changes, and then push those changes back to the remote repository. To keep their local repositories up-to-date, developers pull changes from the remote repository. This push-pull mechanism ensures that everyone has access to the latest version of the project. Additionally, version control systems provide tools for resolving conflicts that may arise when multiple people modify the same file. By using commands like git pull, git push, and git merge, teams can seamlessly integrate changes and maintain a cohesive codebase. This workflow not only enhances collaboration but also provides a safety net, as the entire history of the project is preserved and can be revisited if necessary.
