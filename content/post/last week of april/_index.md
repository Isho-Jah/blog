The last week of April brought a mix of emotions as the month came to a close. T found myself reflecting on the spring season's 
progressing while preparing for May's arrival.

## Some highlights from the week:

- Enjoyed the warmer weather with some outdoor activities

An interesting realization:
Sometimes endings (like April's) make us appreciate the beginnings (like May's) even more. My ex was right about one thing - change 
can be good!

Thanks for following my April journey.
