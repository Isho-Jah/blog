## How my week went

In my second week of March, I explore more of Moscow;s charm. I visited the historic Kremlin, marveling at its cathedrals and the Tsar Bell. I stroll through Zaryadye Park offered stunning views of the city and the Moskva River. I also ventured into the State Historical Museum to dive deeper into Russia's past. I spent my evenings enjoying cozy cafes near  Arbat street, soaking in the lively atmosphere. It was a week filled with history, culture, and unforgettable memories.

Thank you for reading!
